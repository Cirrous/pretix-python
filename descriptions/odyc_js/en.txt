At our Coding in the firestation, kids and teens can bring their own projects and work on them with the support of our mentors.
You don't have an idea yet? No problem, we bring inspiration :) Previous knowledge is not required.

Schedule:
10:50 - 11:00 - Admission
11:00 - 11:15 - Welcome & Ice-Breaker & Setup
11:15 - 12:45 - Programming
12:45 - 13:00 - Show time: who did what today?

What you need:
A device for programming (e.g. laptop, tablet, smartphone). If you don't have one, book an additional computer product or write to us. We'll find a solution!
Paper and pens for your designs and notes.

If you are under 13 years old: One:n legal guardian to accompany you during the dojo. The guardian also needs a separate ticket. If the combination of tickets your family needs is no longer available, just write us and we'll see if we can find a solution.

Friends and siblings are of course also allowed to join! Just book multiple tickets for them. If your siblings are under 7 years old, they don't need their own ticket.

You are also welcome to bring something small to eat/drink. We always try to provide a small buffet.
