In this workshop, you'll dive into one of the most popular programming languages in the world: Python! With the help of Jupyter Notebooks, we’ll code directly in the browser – step by step, and without needing to install anything.

You'll learn how to do calculations with Python, write small programs, and solve simple puzzles. Maybe you’ll even bring your own ideas!
This workshop is perfect for kids aged 10 and up, or for anyone with a bit of experience using Scratch or other learning platforms. Our mentors will be there to support you every step of the way.

What you need:
A device for programming (e.g. laptop, tablet, smartphone). If you don't have one, book an additional computer product or write to us. We'll find a solution!
Paper and pens for your designs and notes.

If you are under 13 years old: One:n legal guardian to accompany you during the dojo. The guardian also needs a separate ticket. If the combination of tickets your family needs is no longer available, just write us and we'll see if we can find a solution.

Friends and siblings are of course also allowed to join! Just book multiple tickets for them. If your siblings are under 7 years old, they don't need their own ticket.

You are also welcome to bring something small to eat/drink. We always try to provide a small buffet.
