In this workshop, we will look at what makes different countries different and build a common world map in Scratch.
You will program a description for a country of your choice. At the end, everything will be put together.

Well suited if you are a beginner or would like to deepen your Scratch skills.

12:45 - 13:00 - Show time: who did what today?

What you need:
A device for programming (e.g. laptop, tablet, smartphone). If you don't have one, book an additional computer product or write to us. We'll find a solution!
Paper and pens for your designs and notes.

If you are under 13 years old: One:n legal guardian to accompany you during the dojo. The guardian also needs a separate ticket. If the combination of tickets your family needs is no longer available, just write us and we'll see if we can find a solution.

Friends and siblings are of course also allowed to join! Just book multiple tickets for them. If your siblings are under 7 years old, they don't need their own ticket.

You are also welcome to bring something small to eat/drink. We always try to provide a small buffet.
