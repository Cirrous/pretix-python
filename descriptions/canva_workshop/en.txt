Workshop: Creative design with Canva - your ideas, your designs!
In this workshop, you'll create cool designs with Canva - e.g. posters, invitations or social media graphics. The free online tool is super easy to use and ideal for creative beginners.

We show you how to combine text, images, colors and layouts to perfectly showcase your ideas. Our mentors will support you step by step.
Join in and create your own designs - in your own style!

What you need:
A device for programming (e.g. laptop, tablet, smartphone). If you don't have one, book an additional computer product or write to us. We'll find a solution!
Paper and pens for your designs and notes.

If you are under 13 years old: One:n legal guardian to accompany you during the dojo. The guardian also needs a separate ticket. If the combination of tickets your family needs is no longer available, just write us and we'll see if we can find a solution.

Friends and siblings are of course also allowed to join! Just book multiple tickets for them. If your siblings are under 7 years old, they don't need their own ticket.

You are also welcome to bring something small to eat/drink. We always try to provide a small buffet.
