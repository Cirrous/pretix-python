What you need:
A device for programming, preferably a laptop. If you don't have one, book an additional computer product or write to us. We will find a solution!
If you like, paper and pens for your notes.

If you are under 13 years old: A parent or guardian to accompany you during the dojo. The legal guardian also needs their own ticket. If the combination of tickets required by your family is no longer available, just write to us and we will see if we can find a solution.

Friends and siblings can of course also take part! Simply book several tickets. If your siblings are under 7 years old, they don't need their own ticket.

If you want, you can also bring something small to eat/drink. We always try to provide a small buffet.
