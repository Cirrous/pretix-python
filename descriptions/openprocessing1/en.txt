Workshop: Creative coding with JavaScript and OpenProcessing
In this workshop, children immerse themselves in the world of programming in a playful way - with JavaScript and the creative platform OpenProcessing! Together we will discover how to create colorful shapes, animations and small works of art with just a few lines of code.
Previous knowledge is not essential - but if you have already worked with Scratch or another learning platform, it will be easier for you to get started. Our mentors will support you every step of the way!
Curious? Then come along and bring your imagination!

What you need:
A PC or laptop for programming. If you don't have one, book an additional computer product or write to us. We'll find a solution!
Paper and pens for your designs and notes.

If you are under 13 years old: A parent or guardian who will accompany you during the dojo. The legal guardian also needs their own ticket. If the combination of tickets required by your family is no longer available, just write to us and we will see if we can find a solution.

Friends and siblings can of course also take part! Simply book several tickets. If your siblings are under 7 years old, they do not need their own ticket.

You are also welcome to bring something small to eat/drink. We always try to provide a small buffet.
